<p class="child"> My country’s name is Pakistan. The meaning of Pakistan is ‘Land of Pure’ in Urdu and Persian. We have a very glorious history. We got independence on 14th August 1947 when Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the visionary leader who succeeded to pass the two-nation theory and bill.

    And Muslims got a different country for them where they can practice Islam properly. That was a blessing for us to have a different country for us. Pakistan is one of the strongest countries in the world in order to Army. But our economy is not as big as expected.But now it is expanding as a republican nation with a good government. It has five different provinces. Each province has its own culture and local languages. But Urdu is the approved and national language of Pakistan. It is a widely known language in the world with a huge amount of speakers.

    Pakistan is one of the most beautiful countries in the world with lots of amazing hills, coastal areas, deserted areas, and snow falling Azad Kashmir. Each part of my country is amazing and I love to travel to every part of it. I am a proud Pakistani and I love my country very much.</b></blockquote>
